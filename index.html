<p>leave out all the rest,这是一首非常不错的音乐. 下面是它的歌词:</p>

<p>I dreamed I was missing
You were so scared
But no one would listen
'Cause no one else cares
After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I'm done here
So if you're asking me I want you to know</p>

<p>When my time comes
Forget the one that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest</p>

<p>Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating
I've shed when I'm near
I'm strong to surface
Not all the way through
I've never been perfect
But neither have you
So if you're asking me I want you to know</p>

<p>When my time comes
Forget the one that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest</p>

<p>Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to have so well
Pretending someone else can come and save me
From myself
I can't be who you are</p>

<p>When my time comes
Forget the one that I've don
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest</p>

<p>Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to have so well
Pretending someone else can come and save me
From myself
I can't be who you are
I can't be who you are</p>
